# readability-score
A project from JBA for analysing the readability score of input text. It includes the Automated Readability Index, the Flesch-Kincaid readability test, the SMOG index and the Coleman-Liau index.

The program takes as input a filepath to the text file as the first command-line parameter. The user may then choose which index they want to know about (or all of them).

Language level: Java 14.
